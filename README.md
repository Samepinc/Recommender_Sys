# Recommender_System 
Basically In This Project We are Designing and implementing Various recommender system using different recommendation algorithms such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering and Hybrid Filtering. 
For Content-Based We are Using a Movie Recommender System which suggests items to users based on the similarity of their preferences and the items in a catalog(Dataset).The Steps Followed Include Data Preprocessing and then making appropriate vectors with the help of countvectorizer function. Also we used cosine similarity to find the good recommendation and then deployed the model in an interface using streamlit.
For Running , just Clone the Repository and run app.py to get the appropritate result and enjoy!

For Collaborative-Based We are Using a Movie Recommender System which recommends items to users based on how other users with similar interests have interacted with those items.The Steps Followed Include Data Preprocessing and making a pivot table and then making appropriate vectors with the help of countvectorizer function. Also we used cosine similarity to find the good recommendation and then deployed the model in an interface using streamlit.
For Running , just Clone the Repository and run app.py to get the appropritate result and enjoy!

For Hybrid-Based a framework is used that combines content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation systems .
